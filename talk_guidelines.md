We are looking forward to having you as a Software Talk presenter for next week's CCQ Retreat, speaking about the PySCF Software. 

Your talk will be for 20 minutes, followed by 5 minutes for questions. Please see the attached agenda to find your time slot. 

For the structure of the talk, we are requesting that you roughly structure your talk into two parts:

1. A broad and accessible introduction to the software:
   - How can people at CCQ get your software and get started? Where is the documentation?
   - How to best utilize the code on the HPC systems here at Flatiron?
   - What are the problems this technique / code can solve? Give one or two concrete examples.
   - What does a small (readable) sample of a code using your software look like?
   - What is the current state of the art? (system sizes / runtime / accuracy / etc.)

2. The status of the software, with forward-looking aspects about future plans and activities.
   Some suggestions:
   - What new features are being added? Or will be added soon?
   - What new problems might be solvable with these features? Or how will the experience change?
   - What high-performance aspects are being pursued [parallelization, GPU, etc.] ?
   - How do you plan to reach and train more users? Do you have innovative ideas about documentation or perhaps workshops and training events?
   - How is your software project likely to connect to other software and projects at CCQ?

As you can see, we'd like the thrust of these talks to be less about covering many features of the library, and more about how people at CCQ might find these relevant for their current or future work, and whether they could get involved with using or developing your software.

Of course, please let us know if we can be helpful in any way with your talk and if you have any thoughts.



# TODO
- Add github screensots
- Show related projects
- Sandbox, but more efficient
- Use `cloc` to show breakdown of pyscf
- Better sense of timings
- Demo of properties (orbitals, density, spin density, AO population)
- Talk about MCSCF?
- Show MPI4PySCF
- Show several slides of the docs
- Show input files early
- Show more complicated theory and then show input files for them
- Show slide with github issues after install instructions
- Show thermo things
- Limit text on slides
- PySCF LAMMPS?
- Mention potential interfaces to other CCQ codes
- Google collab/jupyter notebook demo
- Spin orbit coupling
- Non-collinear spin things (GHF, GKS, GCCSD)
-
