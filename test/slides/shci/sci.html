    <ul>
        <li>It turns out in an FCI wave function, that most of the configurations aren't important. Only a small
            fraction of the configurations are responsible for the majority of the correlation energy.</li>
        <li>Which means that we're spending a lot of "precious" computational resources on configurations that
            aren't that important.</li>
        <li>But the problem is: how can we know which configurations are the important ones without solving the full
            problem?</li>
        <li>Enter the "selected" CI methods, which iteratively grow a set of important configurations and treat the
            remainder perturbatively.</li>
        <li>Our work focuses on a particular flavor of these methods called Heat-bath CI (HCI), where we grow this
            set efficiently.</li>
        <li>In practice, this means that we can correlate many more electrons than FCI.</li>
        <li>FCI/CASCI is limited to correlating around 22e in 22o, we have treated systems with almost two hundred
            orbitals.</li>
        <li>Finally, a bit of jargon that I need to introduce. In HCI we use a single parameter \( \epsilon_1 \).
            Just like in experiments we have little knobs to adjust the settings and \( \epsilon_1 \) is our little
            knob.</li>
        <li>We can continuously tune all the way from HF to FCI, which a nice feature, and throughout the rest of
            the talk, we will show convergence to the FCI answer.</li>
